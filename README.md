## Palindrome Number

Given an integer `x`, return `true` if `x` is a palindrome number.

A palindrome number is a number that remains the same when its digits are reversed. For example, `121` is a palindrome, while `123` is not.

**Example 1:**

Input: x = 121
Output: true

**Example 2:**

Input: x = -121
Output: false
Explanation: From left to right, it reads -121. From right to left, it becomes 121-. Therefore, it is not a palindrome number.

**Example 3:**

Input: x = 10
Output: false
Explanation: Reads 01 from right to left. Therefore, it is not a palindrome number.

**Constraints:**

- `-2^31 <= x <= 2^31 - 1`
